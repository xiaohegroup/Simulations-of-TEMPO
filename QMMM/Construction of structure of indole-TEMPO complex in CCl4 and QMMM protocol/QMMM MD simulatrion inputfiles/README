The ¡°p.top¡± and ¡°pcrd¡± files are the topology and coordinate files generated using LEaP module of the Amber program (Case, D. A. et al. J. Comput. Chem. 2005, 26, 1668-1688.) for the QM/MM MD simulation. The ¡°exe¡± file is an executable file for running the QM/MM MD simulation: performing minimization to relax the system with a weak constraint (corresponding input file is ¡°min1.in¡±); heating the system to room temperature (300 K) in 100 ps with a weak constraint (corresponding input file is ¡°heat.in¡±); running 100 ps classical MD simulation of the weakly restrained TEMPO-indole complex to further relax the system with the periodic boundary condition at 300 K and 1 atm (corresponding input file is ¡°mdc.in¡±); finally, performing 20 ps QM/MM MD simulation with the TEMPO-indole complex partitioned into the QM region and the rest of the system treated by MM at the M06-2X/6-311G**/ff99SB QM/MM level. The ¡°program¡± file is a fortran90 file for extracting the spin densities of all atoms of QM subsystem, this program should be carried out along with the QM/MM simulation after that the first ¡°old.gau_job.log¡±file is generated.
