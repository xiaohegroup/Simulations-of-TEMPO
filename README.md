# Simulations-of-Tempol
Please see QMMM directory for more informations of the QMMM MD simulation.
Please see directory "Tempol with amino acid" for Tempol bind with amino acids. In that directory, each directory is named after the amino acid that binds with Tempol. All structures are named after the binding sites in each directory. For example, in Alanine directory, the Tem_Ala_Ca denotes that the binding site of Tempol and Alaning is CÎ±. The suffix 'log' file is the Gaussian output file. The suffix 'pdb' file is the optimized structure. The cub files are the HOMO, LUMO and SOMO orbital files as its file names.
